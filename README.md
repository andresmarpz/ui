# ui

This website displays some components and interactions I have come across and replicated to learn. I have mainly taken inspiration on [raunofreiberg](https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg), [pacocoursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey), [emilkowalski](https://twitter.com/emilkowalski_) and [leerob](https://twitter.com/leeerob). Props to them for their awesomeness :heart:

## Content

Each of these components has their dedicated route and a short gist about what they do and how I approached building them.

Please do not copy my code directly. You may use it as a means to get inspiration or help yourself getting an idea on how to approach building any of these components.<br/>
